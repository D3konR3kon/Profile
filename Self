I consider myself as a gritty person, who strongly believe in growth mindset and the practice of daily goal setting. I am someone who can adopt to new cchanges especially when dealing wih challenges. I like consuming ccontent that is educational and inspiration just anything that contributes positively in my life. I also suppportt the idea of promoting social software developers.
